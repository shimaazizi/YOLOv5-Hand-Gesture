# YOLOv5-Hand-Gesture
This repository is for implementing YOLOv5 for hand gesture recognition. The dataset consists of 200 images of four hand gesture classes: Fist, OpenPalm, PeaceSign, and ThumbsUp. The dataset was created by myself.


First I did these in my termonal:

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone

cd yolov5

pip install -r requirements.txt  # install

Second I create labels for my images using Roboflow Annotate
